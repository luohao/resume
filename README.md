Experience

##### **Engineering Intern**

Nimble Storage, San Jose CA *05/2015 - 08/2015*

As a summer intern, I work with data service team. I propose and implement two optimizations to improve the performance of the index tree, which improve the write IOPS by 5% and reduce the recovery time by 50%.

##### **Engineering Intern**

Nimble Storage, San Jose CA *05/2014 - 08/2014*

As a summer intern, I work with storage management team. I design and implement a fine-grained model for the volume and snapshot metadata. The new model significantly reduce lock contention and thus speeds up the snapshot creation by up to 3.7x.

##### **Research Intern**

Symantec Research Lab, Mountain View CA *05/2013 - 08/2013*

As a summer intern, I work on the flash cache in Symantec Cluster File System. My intern project is to analyze the workload characteristics and use application based caching hints to decide what data to cache. I design and implement a new caching mechanism and improve the throughput of TPC-C workload by up to 2x. 

Research Interests
